Topicals, including corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, and retinoids, are widely used as the first line of defense for mild to moderate psoriasis due to their localized application and minimal systemic side effects. Systemics, encompassing oral or injectable medications like methotrexate and cyclosporine, are reserved for more severe cases where topical treatments prove inadequate. Biologics, a rapidly growing segment, target specific components of the immune system such as TNF-alpha or IL-17, offering effective relief with fewer systemic side effects compared to traditional systemic treatments.Phototherapy, involving exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, remains a cornerstone in psoriasis management, particularly for patients with widespread disease. It includes both UVB and PUVA therapies, each tailored to the patient's needs and the severity of their condition. Combination therapy, involving the use of two or more treatment modalities simultaneously, is increasingly employed to enhance efficacy and minimize side effects, offering a personalized approach to psoriasis treatment in North America.
