The need for stricter regulations and standardized nutritional values may create barriers to entry for new brands.</li> <li><strong>Market Saturation:</strong> As more brands enter the plant-based formula space, the competition will intensify, potentially leading to oversaturation and price wars.</li></ul><p>Despite these challenges, the growing demand for healthier, more sustainable baby nutrition presents abundant opportunities for innovation and growth. Companies focusing on product quality, transparency, and ethical sourcing are likely to lead the way in this evolving market.</p><p>In conclusion, the plant-based baby formula market has evolved rapidly from 2018 to 2022, and the trajectory for 2023-2033 shows even stronger growth, driven by consumer preferences, health trends, and sustainability concerns.
