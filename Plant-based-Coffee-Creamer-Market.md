These include supply chain issues, fluctuating raw material prices (such as almonds and oats), and the need to balance taste with health-conscious formulations. However, manufacturers are investing in research and development to overcome these barriers and continue delivering high-quality, innovative products.</p><p>With an ever-growing shift towards sustainability and plant-based eating, the market is set to experience continued transformation.
